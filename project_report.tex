\section{Instruction and Summary}

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Which milestones were implemented? \\
    % TODO: List the milestone(s) and in the case of 
    %       Milestones 4 & 5, list what features you 
    %       implemented, sorted into easy and hard 
    %       categories.
    - Milestones 1, 2, 3 has been completed!

    For the snapshot of progress take a look at our Github page. Please contact yehyun.lee@mail.utoronto.ca for access to private repo.

    \item How to view the game:
    % TODO: specify the pixes/unit, width and height of 
    %       your game, etc.  NOTE: list these details in
    %       the header of your breakout.asm file too!
    
    \begin{enumerate}

    \item Run the tetris.asm file in a MIPS IDE such as Saturn or Mars


    \end{enumerate}

\item Game Summary:
% TODO: Tell us a little about your game.
\begin{itemize}
\item Pressing `W" would rotate the tetrominoes 90 degrees clockwise
\item Pressing `S" would decrease the position of incoming tetrominoes by 1 until it collides
\item If it collides, a new tetromino is loaded into the screen.
\item For this game version, the program is design to go on until program stops 
\item Program can be stop by pausing the run or clicking "Q" on the keyboard
\item For now, only a specific tetormino, specified will get dropped. However, in the next update, we will implement the random function to randomize tetrominoes being created.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
    # Major variables:
    # lw $s0 for paint (sw)
    # li $s1 for paint counter (need this for general use)
    # li $s2 for what TETRO, ex) O, J, T, using int; refer to image.
    # li $s3 for what ANGLE ex) 0 is default, 1 is one 90 roration upto 3.
    # li $s4 OTetrominoX
    # li $s5 OTetrominoY
    # lw $s6, ADDR_DSPL
    # lw $s7, ADDR_KBRD
    # a3 for collision

% TODO: If you worked in partners, tell us who was 
%       responsible for which features. Some reweighting 
%       might be possible in cases where one group member
%       deserves extra credit for the work they put in.
